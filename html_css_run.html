        Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data,
         known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions
          without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning
           algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, 
           email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where 
           it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform 
           the needed tasks.
