        Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data,<br>
         known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions<br>
          without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning<br>
           algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, <br>
           email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where <br>
           it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform <br>
           the needed tasks.
